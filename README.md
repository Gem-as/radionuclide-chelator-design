# radionuclide-chelator-design
This repository contains a completed A completed proof-of-concept pipeline that generates 100 candidate chelator SMILES optimized for predicted radionuclide binding (lgK) while satisfying chemical and drug-like constraints. Pipeline includes token-based SMILES generation, stacking regression models, RDKit validation, and diversity filtering.
